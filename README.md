# ElevateVue
An open source program to visualise Elevator Statistics using computer vision. 

The aim of this project is to offer an endstop open source solution to analyse elevator use in commercial, residential and educational settings. 

The workflow planned for the project is as follows. 
1. Video data will be feeded to the program using appropriate floor and building lablings. 
2. The videofeed will be analysed for the 'floor' number text and the extracted values will be stored in a database. 
3. A different program, preferebly modular, will allow the visualisation of the extracted data into meaningful information, such as peak use, frequent stops and downtime. Few corrections may be crowdsourced, which will be integrated to program aswell.


The final version of this project should be able to allow user creation, login and sign up to upload their own feed. A even smarter version would enable live feed from IP cameras to allow live analysis and deployment.
